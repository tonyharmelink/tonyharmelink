      <description>I have been thinking of making a homelab for years, but living in a 700 sqft condo I don&amp;rsquo;t have the room for the basement rack of my dreams. A few months ago with the launch of the Raspberry Pi Model 4 B with 4GB of ram I started looking into building a cluster of them for tooling around at home. I found the Pi Dramble which give me the push to build it out for testing Kubernetes and eventually ESXi on ARM.</description>

      <title>Easy Maintenance Mode vMotion Migration of vGPU Backed VMs</title>

      <description>I ran into this issue earlier and didn&amp;rsquo;t find it well documented.
When you put a vGPU host into maintenance mode, the vGPU VMs don&amp;rsquo;t automatically migrate off of the host. Annoying.
It turns out that vMotion uses DRS to evacuate hosts and DRS doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically act on recommendations for vGPU backed VMs. But we can manually act on the recommendations. Push the apply button in DRS and away it goes.</description>

      <title>Extract VMware Horizon Client MSI in 5.1</title>

      <description>I was working on extracting the MSI for the Horizon Client and noticed that the /x and /extract flags on the VMware Horizon client documentation weren&amp;rsquo;t working for me.
Luckily I did notice a few lines in the log of the installer in my %temp% directory
[6D2C:6D30][2019-09-23T16:11:42]i410: Variable: WixBundleAction = 5 [6D2C:6D30][2019-09-23T16:11:42]i410: Variable: WixBundleElevated = 1 [6D2C:6D30][2019-09-23T16:11:42]i410: Variable: WixBundleInstalled = 1  It&amp;rsquo;s a Wix Bundle installer. These I know how to deal with after exploding and customizing other installers.</description>

      <description>Here is a full CSP method to removing APPX packages from your users environment.
First, get the family names of the packages you want to remove via powershell
Get-AppxPackage | Select Name, PackageFamilyName  Determine the packages you wish to remove and add those names into the CSP similar to below, change the CmdID to be unique within your configuration:
&amp;lt;Delete&amp;gt; &amp;lt;CmdID&amp;gt;105&amp;lt;/CmdID&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Item&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Target&amp;gt; &amp;lt;LocURI&amp;gt;./Device/Vendor/MSFT/EnterpriseModernAppManagement/AppManagement/AppStore/Microsoft.Messaging_8wekyb3d8bbwe&amp;lt;/LocURI&amp;gt; &amp;lt;LocURI&amp;gt;./Device/Vendor/MSFT/EnterpriseModernAppManagement/AppManagement/AppStore/Microsoft.MixedReality.Portal_8wekyb3d8bbwe&amp;lt;/LocURI&amp;gt; &amp;lt;LocURI&amp;gt;./Device/Vendor/MSFT/EnterpriseModernAppManagement/AppManagement/AppStore/Microsoft.NetworkSpeedTest_8wekyb3d8bbwe&amp;lt;/LocURI&amp;gt; &amp;lt;LocURI&amp;gt;./Device/Vendor/MSFT/EnterpriseModernAppManagement/AppManagement/AppStore/Microsoft.WindowsMaps_8wekyb3d8bbwe&amp;lt;/LocURI&amp;gt; &amp;lt;LocURI&amp;gt;./Device/Vendor/MSFT/EnterpriseModernAppManagement/AppManagement/AppStore/Microsoft.Xbox.TCUI_8wekyb3d8bbwe&amp;lt;/LocURI&amp;gt; &amp;lt;LocURI&amp;gt;./Device/Vendor/MSFT/EnterpriseModernAppManagement/AppManagement/AppStore/Microsoft.XboxApp_8wekyb3d8bbwe&amp;lt;/LocURI&amp;gt; &amp;lt;LocURI&amp;gt;.</description>

      <title>VMworld 2019 - My first VMworld</title>

      <description>My first VMworld. It was an awesome time. I highly recommend everyone with an investment or interest in VMware&amp;rsquo;s products to go. I learned so much about how to better use the products I have.
Arriving on Sunday early in the morning made life substantially easier. The registration lines were almost nonexistent, and I was able to get settled in before the Veeam reception at the solutions exchange filled me with beer and a bag full of swag in exchange for hearing about dozens of products.</description>

      <title>Creating 100s of NTFS permissions with Powershell and DSC</title>
      <link>https://tonyh.dev/posts/creating-100s-of-ntfs-permissions-with-powershell/</link>

      <description>Starting at my new employer one of the first major projects to hit implementation phase is a migration of the company file server. The major wrinkle is that the old file server is on Novell, with 25+ years of permission and folder buildup. Millions of files, hundreds of thousands of folders.
The normal Windows to Windows robocopy won&amp;rsquo;t work to preserve permissions, from a Windows perspective the owner and ACL for all files/folders on a Novell share is &amp;lsquo;Everyone.</description>

      <title>The creation of this blog with Hugo, GitHub Pages, Forestry, and Google Domains</title>

      <description>A coworker asked how I setup this blog so for their and others edification I&amp;rsquo;ll put the steps into writing.
I decided I wanted a super simple blog that would render out to static pages so I could leverage GitHub pages for my hosting, leaving my only expense the domain name. So far I have settled on the stack of Google Domains for my domain, GitHub Pages for my hosting, Hugo for my website framework, and am currently toying with Forestry for content management and creation.</description>
