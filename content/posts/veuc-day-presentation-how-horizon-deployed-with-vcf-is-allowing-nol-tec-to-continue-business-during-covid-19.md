title = "vEUC Day Presentation: How Horizon Deployed with VCF is allowing Nol-Tec to continue business during COVID-19"

+++
I did a presentation at the 2020 Minneapolis Virtual EUC Day yesterday.

The entire thing was pre-recorded so I can easily repost it here for all!

The meat of it is the journey on how a 1 year complete EUC overhaul using Horizon deployed with VMware Cloud Foundation combined with Workspace ONE UEM and Workspace ONE Access allowed us to send everyone home at the drop of a hat and maintain productivity when Covid-19 Stay at Home orders came down.

All of our employees, including very intensive 3D CAD users are now fully productive at home and we are able to continue business with little loss in productivity.
