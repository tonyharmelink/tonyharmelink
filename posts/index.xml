      <description>Starting at my new employer one of the first major projects to hit implementation phase is a migration of the company file server. The major wrinkle is that the old file server is on Novell, with 25+ years of permission and folder buildup. Millions of files, hundreds of thousands of folders.
The normal Windows to Windows robocopy won&amp;rsquo;t work to preserve permissions, from a Windows perspective the owner and ACL for all files/folders on a Novell share is &amp;lsquo;Everyone.</description>

      <description>A coworker asked how I setup this blog so for their and others edification I&amp;rsquo;ll put the steps into writing.
I decided I wanted a super simple blog that would render out to static pages so I could leverage GitHub pages for my hosting, leaving my only expense the domain name. So far I have settled on the stack of Google Domains for my domain, GitHub Pages for my hosting, Hugo for my website framework, and am currently toying with Forestry for content management and creation.</description>
